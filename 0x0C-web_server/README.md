WEB SERVER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is part of the ALX software engineering course in partnership with Holberton. This particular 
project was on the basics of a simple server configuration as well as simple deployment of text files to 
a Nginx web server.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The shell command, scp, was utilised to securely copy a file from the host machine to a remote Nginx 
server.
The shell command, ssh-keygen was used to generate a public/private pair of keys to add a layer of 
security while using the scp command.
